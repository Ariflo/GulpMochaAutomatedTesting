## Automated Testing with Gulp-Mocha

This repository will outline the steps necessary to set-up an automated Gulp-Mocha testing suite for your SEAN (SQL with Knex, Express, Angular, Node) web app. 

###File Structure
This demo assumes your SEAN app follows the standard MVC file structure:

```
$tree
├── bin
├── db
├── node_modules
├── models
├── public
│   ├── css
│   ├── partials
│   ├── templates
│   └── js
│       └── main.js
│       └── services.js
│       └── directives.js
│       └── controllers.js
│       └── filters.js
├── routes (controller)
│   └── index.js
└── views
│	 ├── error.ejs
│	 └── index.ejs
├── app.js
├── gulpfile.js
├── knexfile.js
├── package.json

```

Type `yo galvanize-fullstack` into the commandline to get a basic skelton like the above file structure. [See the npm details here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-galvanize-fullstack)

##Step 1: Install the Gulp Test Suite

You will need to enter the following into your terminal command line

```
$ npm i  gulp mocha chai gulp-mocha gulp-util supertest -g
$ npm i  gulp mocha chai gulp-mocha gulp-util supertest --save
```
For those inquiring: 

- [`Gulp`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) is a build system that will assist in running the test code. I like to think of it as a task manager that can watch for file changes and trigger tests automatically.

- [`Mocha`](https://mochajs.org/)is a test framework that will provide the instruments needed to run the actual test. Popular alternative to Mocha is Jasmine. You can learn more about the diffrence between two [here](http://thejsguy.com/2015/01/12/jasmine-vs-mocha-chai-and-sinon.html)

- [`Supertest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level of abstraction for testing HTTP (ie.routes), while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by super-agent. In layman terms, "no crossing swords" :), or ports in this case. You can test your express app's routes and not have to worry about whether the app is running or not. It truly is super!    

##Step 2: Create a Test folder and Test file

This folder will hold all of your test.js files

```
$ mkdir test
$ cd test 
$ touch firstTest.js 
```
##Step 3: Create and build your gulpfile.js file

You'll want to create a gulpfile.js outside of the test folder if you don't have it already
 
```
$ touch gulpfile.js
```

Now, you'll need to make sure to require the gulp build system you installed earlier at the top of the gulpfile:

```
var gulp = require('gulp');
var mocha = require('gulp-mocha');
var util = require('gulp-util');

```

Alright, now its task time, like I mentioned before [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) is at its heart a task runner that wants to excute a list of commands you give it to do. 

With this in mind, lets add a couple tasks to our gulpfile:

```
/**
 * Gulp Tasks
 */
 
gulp.task('test', function () {
    return gulp.src(['test/**/*.js'], { read: false })
        .pipe(mocha({ reporter: 'spec' }))
        .on('error', util.log);
});
 
gulp.task('watch-test', function () {
    gulp.watch(['views/**', 'public/**', 'app.js', 'framework/**', 'test/**'], ['test']);
});

// *** default task *** //
gulp.task('default', ['test', 'watch-test'], function(){});
```

Great! Now when the ‘gulp’ command is entered into your terminal, it will search for the ‘default’ task and execute whatever task is provided, in this case we send it to run our other tasks (*test* and *watch-test*).

'test' has the duty of running our mocha tests

 



‘gulp test’ on the command line in order to achieve the same result that we did with mocha. Second task that we have defined, with the name ‘watch-test’ watches out for the folders that I have specified here, views, public and test for file changes, if it finds any, it automatically run the ‘test’ task and report the test results. I have also included app.js which is my main Node.js file, and framework folder, where I like to put all my Node.js code. Lets go ahead execute the following:
The default task at the end there will be what Gulp immediately l
